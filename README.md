My-homepage:
===========
This is the homepage that I currently use. 

I am currently on version 4.0 (because if all the cool kids steal from EVA then I see no reason why I shouldn't) of this page. 

Although I designed this with full monitors in mind, this will work with laptops (*/note that there are small bugs when viewing on a laptop. Nothing that breaks everything, but you probably will notice it*/). Currently, this homepage works on the main web browers (IE 11, Chrome, Firefox, Chropera and probably Safari but I don't feel like downloading it for testing so let me know if you like).

I tested it on my phone and it works on it so I guess that it will work on tablets but I have no intention on making sure that it works properly on them.

Here is a demo of my page:

Future plans: 
===========

I was thinking of incorporating RSS feeds in but I am honestly fine with the way it works now. My concern is that if I add things like rss, it could interupt the flow of things and that is not something that I want to do so I may make another homepage in another style to make that work. Maybe.

After that rambling I guess that the plan is just to iron out bugs and leave it as is unless I get inspired by something and testing goes super well.

Small Webm:
==========

Coming Soon! Basically all this will be is showing the evolution of this side project of mine if you are intersted in such things. I have uploaded the file in a few of the homepage threads so sorry if you have seen it before.

Thanks for viewing this page!
